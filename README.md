### Program Number 1 : We have the Map of Romania. In this map, the distance between various places in Romania is given. If we have to reach from one place to another place there exist several paths. Write a Python Program to find the shortest distance between any two places using a A* search algorithm.

### Program Number 2 : Simulate the smart vacuum cleaner agent that cleans rooms size of n * n. The Agent can move Up, Down, Left, Right. calculate performance each round  

---

### Program Number 3 : Write a program to implement Alpha Beta pruning in Python. The algorithm can be applied to any depth of tree by not only pruning the tree leaves but also the entire subtree. Order the nodes in the tree such that the best nodes are checked first from the shallowest node.

### Program Number 4 : Implementation of Tic Tac Toe game here ,the player needs to take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid with their own marks, if 3 consecutive marks (Horizontal, Vertical,Diagonal) are formed then the player who owns these moves get won. Noughts and Crosses or X’s and O’s abbreviations can be used to play.

### Program Number 5 : Write a program to implement McCulloch-Pitts algorithms, for realizing the AND/OR/XOR/ANDNOT logic functions. 

---

### Program Number 6 : Implement the Perceptron Learning single layer Algorithm by Initializing the weights and threshold. Execute the code and check, how many iterations are needed, until the network converge.

---

### Program Number 7 : Demonstrate the working of SVM classifier for a suitable data set

---

### Program Number 8 : Demonstrate Genetic algorithm by taking a suitable data for any simple application
